# Uncut
Films have been part of our culture since ten of Lumière brothers short films were screened in Paris in 1895,
giving birth to the so-called “seventh art”. Reviews have been part of the filmmaking culture since its
origins, starting as an elite-reserved activity to a task that everyone can do using apps such as IMdb.

Uncut is a mobile app that wants to bring the decentralisation of film reviews to the next stage.
